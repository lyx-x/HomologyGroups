## Persistence and Homology groups

This program implements a basis algorithm to compute persistence. It is suggested to have [Glog](https://github.com/google/glog) in order to compile
it and using Clion is even better as you don't need to change the CMakeList file. All data are inside the repository. You can also test on your own filtration files.

Files in the utilities will help you to use this program and to generate filtration files for n-sphere and n-ball.
